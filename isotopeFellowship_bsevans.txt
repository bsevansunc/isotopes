\noindent {\textbf {1. BACKGROUND}}\par
Urbanization during the latter half of the twentieth century has altered habitats, restructured avian communities, and influenced the range sizes and population dynamics of animal species (Mckinney and Lockwood 1999, Marzluff 2001, Chace and Walsh 2006). The unique characteristics of human-built environments confers a conflicting set of benefits and challenges that make it difficult to determine whether urban habitats are advantageous or constitute demographic sinks (Gates and Gysel 1978) for bird populations. As the developed land area in the United States is projected to nearly double between 2000 and 2025 (Alig et al. 2004), understanding how organisms respond to these habitats is of paramount importance. Despite the urgency of the problem for conservation, however, the population level consequences of urbanization on birds remain poorly understood (Shochat et al. 2006). \par


\noindent {\textbf {2. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE}}\par
Here, we seek to assess the influence of urban land cover on avian diet and the effects of dietary habits on the health of birds across the rural-to-urban gradient.

\noindent{\textbf{Hypothesis 1. The dietary habits of conspecific birds vary in composition and breadth along the rural-to-urban gradient. }} \\ Across bioregions, urban environments have been shown to favor dietary generalists and granivores and exclude birds with insectivorous diets. Indeed, in an assessment of avian community composition across the rural-to-urban gradient in metropolitan Washington, D.C. we observed a sharp decline in the proportional abundance of obligate insectivores (Evans et al. 2015). (Note: Bearhop 2004 suggested that isotopes can be a proxy for niche width)\\

\underline{Prediction 1.1}: \textit{The ratios of $\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N exhibited by individuals will reflect dietary shifts from insect to plant-based and anthropogenic food sources.}  \\

\underline{Prediction 1.2}: \textit{The dietary niche width, measured as the variance in the ratios of $\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N,  exhibited by individuals will increase with increasing urban land cover.} Change this bit, see Newsome's paper -- Shannon-Weiner metric \\


\noindent{\textbf{Hypothesis 2. Urban habitats provide a more consistent temporal distribution of resources that minimizes starvation pressures}} \\ 



\noindent{\textbf{Hypothesis 3. The condition of birds in urban habitats is enhanced by dietary plasticity and a consistent supply of resources.}} \\ Lorem ipsum yada yada yada \\
\underline{Prediction 3}: \textit{The variance in the ratio of $\delta^{13}$C: $\delta^{15}$N  exhibited by individuals will increase with increasing urban land cover.}
To examine the adult condition of birds, we will measure the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in feathers using a methanol based extraction, modified from Bortolotti et al. (2008), and a commercial ELISA kit (Corticosterone ELISA kit; Neogen Corporation, Ayr, UK) following Carbajal et al. (2014). The concentration of CORT in feathers represents stress exposure during the time in which the feather was grown, a period of up to three weeks. Feather CORT has been found to be predictive of several biologically important indicators of bird health including breeding success (Crossin et al. 2013), body condition (Harms et al. 2010), and survival (Koren et al. 2012). We will analyze CORT concentrations as a function of neighborhood and yard-scale habitat and management practices within a generalized linear model framework, using model selection to determine the variables most predictive of avian condition (see Burnham and Anderson 2002). Preliminary analysis of CORT in Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) feathers at NN sites (n = 22) exhibit elevated CORT concentrations in sites dominated by non-native plants ($\beta$ = -3.2 $\pm$ 1.4, p-value = 0.04) but no response to the degree of urbanization at a given site (proportion of impervious surface within 500 m, $\beta$ = 0.2 $\pm$ 0.3, p-value = 0.47). These results suggest that CORT concentrations may be highly reflective of the biological response of birds to yard-scale habitat features.

\noindent{\textbf{Hypothesis 4. Local-scale habitat features moderate the influence of urban land cover on bird health and dietary habits}} \\ Lorem ipsum yada yada yada \\
\underline{Prediction 4}: \textit{$\beta$ estimates associated with the influence of urban land cover on the values of, and variance in $\delta^{13}$C: and $\delta^{15}$N  ratios and corticosterone levels will be moderated or enhanced by local habitats features.}
We will use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM; McCune and Grace 2002) to examine hypothesized relationships between environmental attributes, place meaning, place attachment, and place-enhancing behaviors (Fig. 3). SEM is a multivariate technique that allows us to simultaneously analyze the complex, and often correlated, inter-relationships among measured (e.g., socioeconomics and land-cover) and latent variables (i.e., those estimated from measured values such as environmental attributes and place attachment) that comprise a coupled human-natural system. We will use a Bayesian framework to develop and test a priori SEM in JAGS, implemented in Program R (see Plummer et al. 2003). We will evaluate the influence of structural linkages using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and use Bayesian model selection to compare a priori models (see Raferty 1993). SEMs will include socio-economic factors since these characteristics might influence maintenance decisions, as well as personal histories (e.g., prior/other nature experiences from open-ended interviews) and the amount of urban land and tree cover in the neighborhood surrounding participantsâ€™ households (as described in the Research Overview section above). With SEM, we will distinguish the relative influence of environmental and sociocultural attributes on management decisions and the linkages among environmental/sociocultural attributes, place meanings, place attachments, and place-enhancing behaviors (Fig. 3). The SEM for Objective 3 will be incorporated into the SEM for the overall project model (see Synthesis section below).
