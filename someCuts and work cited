Fairhurst et al. (2015) examined $\delta^{13}$C,  $\delta^{15}$N, and CORT in feathers of seabirds and found that trophic position was negatively correlated with CORT, suggesting that feeding at higher trophic positions had physiological benefits for indiviudals through increased nutrition or reduced foraging costs.

CORT
I would predict that the non-native plants have a negative affect on corticosterone during the summer months, due to a an expected decrease in the number of arthropods and a positive affect during the winter months due to utilization of non-native plant fruits (see Bartusveige and Gorchov 2006)


The low temporal variability of resources in anthropogenic habitats is also hypothesized to support higher densities of individuals because they can persist in a state of reduced body condition relative to their rural counterparts (the Credit Card Hypothesis, Shochat 2004). 



Availability of winter fruit resources on non-native and ornamental plants may provide relaxation from starvation pressures during winter months when survival of the resident species is dependent on a consistent food supply (Shochat et al. 2010).
